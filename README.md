The use of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin is becoming increasingly common among investors in recent years. It is common knowledge that the cryptocurrency market is volatile, and that its unpredictability is due to the various factors that influence it. 

These factors include current events, trends, the inflation rate, the economy, and natural disasters. A significant number of investors put their faith in tweets from Twitter and utilise them as a source of daily trading guidance. 

In the study that has been proposed, an investigation of the public sentiment on Twitter regarding cryptocurrencies has been carried out. This solution will gather all of the tweets connected to crypto by utilising the hashtags, sanitise the data, and then create a dataset with it. Utilizing the dataset, a machine learning module has been implemented in order to analyse the general public's opinion on the tweet. 

The purpose of this research is to determine whether the general population has a good, negative, or neutral attitude about cryptocurrency. The findings of the solution might serve as a point of reference for prospective investors in the cryptocurrency market.
